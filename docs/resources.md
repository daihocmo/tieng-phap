### Alternative Pathway for Beginners

- **From Charlie Chaplin**: Beginners struggling with Refold can use a French beginner course (book and audio) from a public library alongside the 300-word Anki deck. Adapt the course by:
  - Listening without speaking aloud.
  - Avoiding translation to your native language.
  - Not memorizing or aiming for 100% understanding; move to the next lesson daily.
  - Example: Use Assimil’s book and audio, listening and reading each lesson without translating. Midway, revisit lessons and create Anki sentence cards for unfamiliar words, then start immersing with easy media like [Alice Ayel](https://www.youtube.com/c/aliceayel/featured).
